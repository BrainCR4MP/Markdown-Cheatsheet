## Other places where *Markdown Here* works

Besides Thunderbird, Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo, *Markdown Here* has been found to work in...

### Google Groups

*Markdown Here* works in the Google Groups rich-compose box. With caveats:

* When viewing a rendered post with the web interface, all colouring is lost.
* Digest emails strip all styling. 
* Per-message emails behave oddly: 
  * They look great in Thunderbird -- all styling and colours intact.
  * In Gmail, like the web interface, all colour styling is lost.

Regardless, it's still very nice to be able to do use Markdown backticks and bullets and link syntax while writing Google Groups posts.
