## Other places where *Markdown Here* works

Besides Thunderbird, Gmail, Hotmail, and Yahoo, *Markdown Here* has been found to work in...

### Google Groups

*Markdown Here* works with Google Groups posts. You can use it in the GG rich compose box, or when you're posting via email. One caveat: Digest emails strip all styling. 

### Evernote

[A user discovered](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/issues/30#issuecomment-8119861) that Markdown Here works in the Evernote web interface. 

Caveat: It seems that newlines are stripped out of code blocks, so they display as a single line.
